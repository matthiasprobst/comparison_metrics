# Comparison metrics

This is a small library providing comparison metrics. Main motivation is to
use such metrics for vector field comparisons in fluid dynamic problems such as
comparing computational fluid dynamic simulations (CFD) with particle image velocimetry (PIV)
measurements.

**NOTE**: This repository is under current development!

## Installation
Clone the repository and call
```
pip install comparison_metrics
```
or for development purpose:
```
pip install -e comparison_metrics
```

### Testing
Go to the directory and run:

```
pytest
```
